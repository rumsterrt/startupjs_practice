    description:
      "The light on the beverage station seems to be left on at all times. I'm guessing this is true due to the fact that guest call at least 4 times a week asking how to turn it off. If this is true could we maybe leave the light off and if they need it on they would call to find out how to turn it on because the switch is not easy to find. And it is usually in the middle of the night when they discover it and can't sleep.\nJust asking it seems that would serve the guest better.",
